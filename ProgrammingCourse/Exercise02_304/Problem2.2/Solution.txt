a) ./TabularizeFunction > ../Problem2.2/table.dat 

b) Instead of cout we use cerr to request the user input.
Therefore we use a differen output stream to 
later redirect the output of the programm.

c) ./TabularizeFunction < ../Problem2.2/parameter.in 

d) ./TabularizeFunction 2> /dev/null
This redirects the error stream into the void. 
The output of the error is therefore not shown in the terminal and discarded.
