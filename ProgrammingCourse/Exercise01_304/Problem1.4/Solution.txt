Line 12: For-loop
        Iterate through the code block until a condition is met.
        In this example inkrement i while it is less than N. If
        it is greater of equal to N the for-loop stops.

Line 24: If-Else
        If the condition in the brakets is true go in the first block
        If the condition is not true go in the else block.
