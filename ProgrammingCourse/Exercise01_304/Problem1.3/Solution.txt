Programm 1.3

a)
Line 3: Missing semicolon after "using namespace std"
        This is shown in err.log Line 1 - 7

Line 5: keyword void should be int 
        This is shown in err.log Line 8 - 10 

Line 10: "cout >>" should face in the other direction
        This is shown in err.log Line 12 - 96

Line 11: b was never declared 
        This is shown in err.log Line 97-99
 
b) g++ Divide.cpp 2> err.log

c) The programm was not showing the right behaviour 
because it was calculating an integer division in line 14, i.e 
if you passed 1 and 2 as values you got 0 as an answer.
To fix this, the variables a and b have to be declared as an double value.

d) g++ Divide.cpp -o Divide -Wall

(original code) Line 17: The value z is unused in the code and should be removed from the script.
        This is shown in the warnings.log on line 1-4

(original code) Line 18: The value y (and z aswell) is not initlized in the script. 
        Therefore printing this value is causing a really small number to appear. 
        This leads to the assumption that due to the declaration as an 
        double a floating point error occurs.
        This is shown in the warning.log on line 5-6

Therefore removing
"double y,z;
 cout << "y = " << y << endl;"
is the way to prevent further issues.
