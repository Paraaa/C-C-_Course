a) The period of the LCG ist 32 
numbers long. The sequence of numbers
repeats after this period. One can see 
this period in the plotA.png and dataA.dat

b)
The period of the LCG changes to 16(half 
of the period of the previous setting (c=7)).

c) The maximum period length is only 
achieved if the increment value c 
is coprime to the modulo m.
In the case of c=6 this is not case. 
Therefore the period length is smaller 
then for c=7.
