a)
The program prints random continuous
numbers in the range from 1 to 4.
The user can give an argument to the programm
to set the amount of printed random numbers.

b)
The same sequence of "random" numbers occure.
This due to the fixed seed given in the 
srand() function. 
Due to the deteministic behaviour of 
an computer system one can only 
create pseudo-numbers and 
therefore needs alternative methods.

See: https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/srand/

c)
If you look at the documentation of
srand() one can use the system time as 
a seed. Each call of the srand() function
the system time determined and used 
as an input. Therefore the function is 
time-variant and produces different 
outputs at each time.
