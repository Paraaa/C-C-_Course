b)
If you try to execute 'make' again the following
message is printed to the terminal: 

"make: Nothing to be done for 'all'."

This message shows that there is nothing to do due
to the fact that the programm was already build. 

c) 
The make operation just recompiles the changed 
files: 

g++ -O3 -Wall -c SortedRandom.cpp
g++ -O3 -Wall Rnd.o Sorting.o SortedRandom.o -o SortedRandom

d) 
No it does not work for header files yet. 

One has to add the corrosponding header files to the 
makefile to enable this behaviour.
